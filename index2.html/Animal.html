    <h2>Chickens</h2>
    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl.<p> <p><em>It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,</em> with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.</p> <p>There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl<strong></strong></p> Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.</strong></p> Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period.

     <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast Asia, East Asia,[4] and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe,<br> the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.</p> From India, the domesticated chicken was imported to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC.
     <p> Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt <br>from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia.</p>
